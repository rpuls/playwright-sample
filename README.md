## Pre-requisites

1. Clone the LambdaTest-Playwright repository on your system.

2. Install the npm dependencies.

```
npm install
```

3. In order to run your Playwright tests, you will need to set your LambdaTest username and access key in the environment variables. Click the **Access Key** button at the top-right of the Automation Dashboard to access it.

**Windows**

```js
set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```

**macOS/Linux**

```js
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```

## Run Your First Playwright Test

>**Test Scenario**: The sample playwright-single.js file search the term 'LambdaTest' on Bing.

Shown below are the steps on running Playwright tests on the LambdaTest platform. 

1. Clone the LambdaTest-Playwright GitHub repository and switch to the cloned directory.

```js
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample.git
cd playwright-sample
```

2. Ensure you have npm dependencies installed. 

3. Configure your LambdaTest authentication credentials.

Once you are done with the above-mentioned steps, you can initiate your first Playwright test on LambdaTest. 

Check out [playwright-single.js](https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample/blob/main/playwright-single.js) file to view the sample test script.


4. Pass the below command to run the test.

```
node playwright-single.js
```

## View your Playwright test results

The LambdaTest Automation Dashboard is where you can see the results of your Playwright tests after running them on the LambdaTest platform. 

The below screenshot of LambdaTest Automation Dashboard shows the Playwright build on the left and the build sessions associated with the selected build on the right.

## Parallel Testing With Playwright


LambdaTest allows you to perform parallel testing with Playwright across 40+ browsers and OS to automate your several test cases simultaneously. You can run one test case across various browsers, or you can run multiple test case scenarios in the same browser with different browser versions.


Shown below are the steps on running parallel tests with Playright on the LambdaTest platform. 

1. Clone the LambdaTest-Playwright GitHub repository and switch to the cloned directory.

```js
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample.git
cd playwright-sample
```

2. Ensure you have npm dependencies installed. 

3. Configure your LambdaTest authentication credentials.

Once you are done with the above-mentioned steps, you can run your parallel tests with Playwright on LambdaTest. 

**Test Scenario**: Check out [playwright-parallel.js](https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample/blob/main/playwright-parallel.js) file to view the sample test script.

4. Pass the below command to run the test.

```
node playwright-parallel.js
```
